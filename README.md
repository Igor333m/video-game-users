# Todo

For this exercise, imagine that you're building a section of a simple video game
website where we should be able to add users and display users, along with the
number of games he/she has played.

## **Task**:
Create a React app that lets us add a user's first name, last name, and
username. When the user is added, the number of games that he/she has played is
defaulted to 0. Each username has to be unique, so we cannot add multiple users
with the same username. When someone clicks "Add" but the username already
exists, the app should not allow for a duplicate user to be added and should
show an error message instead.

The app should also display a list of users, specifically their usernames
and the number of games they've played (which is defaulted to 0).
If someone
tries to add a user when one of the fields is empty, the "Add" button should
be disabled.

We should also have a button that lets us toggle between showing and hiding
the number of games the users have played.
For example, the button can start out as
```Hide the Number of Games Played``` and the app can display
```username1
played 0 games.``` Clicking that button should change the button text to
```Show the Number of Games Played```
and the displayed username and score can be
changed to
```username1 played \* games.```
